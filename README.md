# 📷 Image Processing with NumPy and OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to apply **image blurring**, **edge detection (Sobel filter)**, and **color inversion** using **NumPy** and **OpenCV** in Python.

## 🚀 Features

- **Box Blur & Gaussian Blur** for image smoothing.
- **Edge Detection** using the Sobel filter.
- **Image Inversion** to flip pixel values.
- Works with **grayscale and color images**.

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```
